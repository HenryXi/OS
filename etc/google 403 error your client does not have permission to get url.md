# google 403 error your client does not have permission to get url
Today I meet this error when I use Chrome google something. I change the search word the error is still there.
After restarting Chrome I try to google again it is still doesn't work. To solve this problem just clear the cache
of Chrome like following.
Press `CTRL+SHIFT+DEL` and click the button ;)
