# Intellij IDEA keyboard shortcuts not working
I use Intellij IDEA on Linux Mint. Today I found the shortcut `Alt + Insert` not working. I guess other program may register
the same shortcut(`Alt + Insert`). I close other programs and retry the shortcut again. It's still not working. I know
this shortcut may conflict with the system hotkey. 

**Solution**

I open `Window Manager` and find the same this hotkey. `Alt + Insert` is used to add workspace on Linux Mint on default. 
After removing it, `Alt + Insert` is working fine in Intellij IDEA.
