# CentOS config double network adapter
When you install CentOS in virtual machine you need to config double network adapters. One is for connecting internet another is 
for ssh. For more detail you can click [VirtualBox CentOS static ip address](http://www.henryxi.com/virtualbox-centos-static-ip-address).

It is more troublesome to configure a second network card after the installation is complete. Recently I discovered that 
during the installation, a second network card can be configured in the graphical interface. 

When you set root password you can see the network configuration is below.
