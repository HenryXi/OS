# Quickly open cmd with current path in Windows
I don't like command prompt in windows. Linux command line is more power than windows. You can't even use
``tab`` to auto-complete the path accurately, especially you install the software in ``C:\Program Files``. 
But, compare with opening a virtual machine installing software in windows is more convenient. 
Every time when I need use command prompt in windows I have to do following steps. 

* open command prompt 
* open the directory where the command located 
* copy the path
* type ``cd `` paste the path
* type the target command

It waste a lot of time. Today I found the quick way to open the command prompt with current path.
It is easy to open the directory where the command located. You can use [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)
to quickly find any file and open the path. In Windows explorer there is a quickest way to open command prompt
 quickly.

* press ``alt + d`` in windows explorer to move the focus to the location bar
* type ``cmd`` 

Use the method above you can open command prompt with current path quickly.
