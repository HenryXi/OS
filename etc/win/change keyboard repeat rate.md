# Change keyboard repeat rate
A key will repeat when you press and hold down it. You can change the repeat rate (make it quicker or slower). 
Open "control panel" -> search "keyboard" in the top right input box. Click "Keyboard" to open "keyboard properties"
dialog box. You can see there are two scroll bars. The first one is for repeat delay and the other is for repeat rate.
Now you can adjust them. Do not forget click "OK" button.
